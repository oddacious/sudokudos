## Acknowledgements

First and foremost, to all the people who organize sudoku events, design puzzles, contribute to the
events in any way, and participate as solvers. The sudoku community is wonderful.

Data for the Sudoku Grand Prix comes from the GP website at
[https://gp.worldpuzzle.org](https://gp.worldpuzzle.org/). World Sudoku Championship data comes
from the various WSC host pages (see
[https://wpc.puzzles.com/history](https://wpc.puzzles.com/history), although note that many of the
links are now dead), from the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org) of those pages, or from files
that others have helpfully shared.

Authoritative results, and the official presentation of those results, belongs to those
organizations. I apologize for any errors in my calculations or representations.
